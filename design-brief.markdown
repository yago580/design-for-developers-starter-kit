# Blog Design Brief

## A brief summary of the business / site goals.
With this site I aim to contribute to the Ruby community by posting weekly blogs. These blogs will detail challenges I have faced while working on client apps. The main reason for doing this is to force myself to solidify my learning enough to teach others, and to showcase my projects.

## The key users.
**Me** - The design should inspire me to write posts!

**Readers** - It should be easy on the eyes, but also capture the reader's attention. I want the design to be minimal, powerful, and cohesive. The blog posts will be related to my portfolio projects.

## Scenarios in which your app or site will be used.
I will be adding blogs, and readers will be reading them. I will also use this site to showcase my projects to potential employers.

## Design style guidelines to follow.
* Clean
* Confident
* Intelligent
* Bash Geek
* Ruby
